# Phase 3 Project Frontend: Alabama's Best Music Festivals ðŸ¤ 


## Overview

We ain't got much in Alabama, but we do got some good music festivals! ðŸ¤  In this app, I list out some of the best music festivals we have to offer including their official name, city, the month they occur (dates often vary), and their website.

Are we missing any? You're fully free to add your own and add a review. You can even review the existing ones!

Did you make a typo? No worries! You can edit a review. Or maybe you changed your mind :)

## Frontend Setup

To set up your front end, first run
```console
$ npm install
```
then run 
```console
$ npm run server
```
lastly, 
```console
$ npm start
```

The application is now running! 

If you forgot to set up the backend, [go here](https://github.com/brantae/project-3-backend)!

## Stretch Goals

It is pretty basic for now. Plans for images, headliners, dark/light mode, and more will be in the works!
